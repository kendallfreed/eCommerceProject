## eCommerce Project
Created Spring backend to connect and function with Angular and SQL database provided. This included using mappings in Spring, connecting the Entities to create a cross table for checkout service, creating an order tracking number, and connecting Spring to the SQL database provided.
The end result was a website where the user could create a customer and then checkout a vacation (with an option to select party size), excursions to add on to the vacation, and checkout with the order tracking number and total cost displayed. 

## Developed Using
